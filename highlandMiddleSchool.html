			Background &#8211; Highlands Partnership
		</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            The relationship between The Ed Colina Foundation and Highlands Middle School in Ft. Thomas, KY began when 6th grade teacher Teresa D&#8217; Ambrosio was flipping channels of television and came across a world culture lesson being taught. Along with fellow teacher Rick Rafferty, the two incorporated world culture issues into their lessons three years ago. Once the students became aware of world hunger and poverty in Africa, they naturally wanted to do something about it. The students began to raise money for international organizations but had difficulty communicating with the larger organizations they were supporting such as Heifer International.

            <strong>A Local Connection In Africa</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Through a <a href="http://servicelearning.childreninc.org/">Service Learning Link</a> &#8211; Children&#8217;s Inc. two teachers were made aware of The Ed Colina Foundation and Ed&#8217;s roots as a Northern Kentucky educator, now initiating projects in Kenya. As early as October, 2010, Highlands Middle School made contact with Ed and his empowerment projects. The relationship began with the sale of Kenyan jewelry through Ed&#8217;s Foundation. The sale was a huge success with the students. Over the years, the Highlands&#8217; classrooms were visited by Ed and St. Henry District H.S. student Michael Best, who had visited Ed&#8217;s projects in Kenya. The relationship between Highlands Middle School and The Ed Colina Foundation grew and the students began to delve deeper into the causes and affects of poverty in Kenya. Because if the close communications with the African projects, the students were excited and willing to look for solutions to some of the unique African issues.

            <strong>Not Just Sending Money</strong>
        </p>


        <p>
            Let&#8217;s face it, money alone set to Africa can be empowering but can also lead to dependency. The students were determined to make a difference and that difference was education. In 2012, students at Highlands Middle School raised $5000 to build preschool classrooms in the small village of Eluaai, outside of Nairobi, Kenya. The students heard presentations from Ed Colina as well as Kenyan Benson Lotiang&#8217;a. Meeting Benson personally and sharing lunch with him, the students were able to put a Kenyan face on their hard work on behalf of Ben&#8217;s homeland. Students reviewed the classroom construction budget and prepared their plan of action. With the help of family and friends, the students surpassed their goal and were able to present Ed and Benson a check in May, 2013. The construction of the classroom is currently underway (October 2013).

            <strong>A New School Year &#8211; A New Goal!</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            Not satisfied to just build classrooms, the students and their teachers knew that the key to a successful project is<strong>sustainability</strong>. How can the schools remain in operation once the initial donations are depleted? The Ed Colina Foundation has a number of income-generating activities which are key to the sustainability of the Foundation&#8217;s four preschools. A four-acre farm for feeding projects and vegetable sales, three chicken coops producing eggs for sale, goat and cow cooperatives, and Kenyan beadwork all provide income.

            <strong>Highlands 2013-14 Project</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            But there is a special project we have wanted to do at the Foundation&#8217;s Machakos (town) chicken coop. The Kenyan government has recently increased the tax on chicken feed (and most items) in Kenya. Because of this, the Foundation has had difficulty making a good profit from its egg sales. One thing that would help our profit is if the Foundation made its own chicken feed. It is a bit of a complicated process but costs of chicken food would be reduced dramatically.
        </p>
        <p>
            What is necessary is a new building structure and a poshomill (an electric milling machine to grind large quantities of maize and other ingredients). We need a large workspace and room for storing ingredients, picked eggs and the finished feed. The workspace/storeroom would be constructed similar to other buildings the Foundation has built; iron-sheets, cemented floors and windows. Highlands Middle School is committed to funding this endeavor and the Foundation remains so grateful!

            <strong>Highlands Answered the Call in 2013-14</strong>
        </p>
        <p>

            Highlands Middle School generously raised the funds necessary to build a new storage building where food for the chickens could be made and stored. They also donated a new electric poshomill (grinder) to make the feed from maize and the many other ingredients! The added task was to run electricity from the road to the storage building. This was completed in February 2014 and the mill is operational, saving us so much money that can be used elsewhere. We are so grateful to this year&#8217;s class for their hard work and generosity! Thanks to students, teachers, staff, parents and other
            < relatives &#8211; the students learned an important lesson on sustainability (teaching a man to fish) and the students in Kenya now have an income-generating activity that betters their lives! </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>And Now for the 2014-2015 Class Project!</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Already the students from Highlands have held a sale of our Kenyan jewelry and crafts, raising money for our projects. But now the big push is on and the fundraising begins in earnest for an exciting endeavor into farming and finding a good water source for the farm as well as the surrounding village. We need to dig a shallow well. Shallow but we believe water can be found at 38ft.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The water is specifically for the farm. The well will be located on the farm land which we will soon farm, once water is found. Water in this area is difficult to find. It is far from the river. The area where the well is to be dug is called Vota Ranch. Initially this area was inhabited by white colonists who sold it back to the locals when they went back to Europe. Previously we farmed an area near the Athi River, close to where Ed Colina stays, but we had difficulty with hippos and monkeys. We need a place that has water, good soil and security. Currently, the people living around our new farm walk close to 10 km for water and pay 10 shillings for 20 liters. We will plant good food and can sell to the locals there, helping with the food shortages, due to drought. The farm will need farmhand(s) and so a simple house is also necessary. The farm-workers work the land but also act as night guards. Our farm equipment, water pump etc. will be stored in the house. This is a simple iron sheet structure, more like a shed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So we are so grateful that Highlands Middle School students have taken on this water and agriculture project. Just like the Highlands chicken project, this is yet another step to making our projects sustainable. Profits from this farm will go to offset costs of our school and feeding projects. The food produced on the farm can be sold and some will be used in our school feeding projects. Thanks to all students, parents, grandparents friends and relatives for considering a donation to our work in Kenya!
