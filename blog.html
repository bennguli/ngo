    <h1>Experience of “the One”.</h1>

    <p>by Ed Colina </p>

    <p><i><a href="http://www.edcolinafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/7.jpg"></a>“Lord when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or ill or in prison and not minister to your needs?”</i></p>

    <p>Today’s Gospel reading is, for me, the core teaching of Jesus. How could I have missed this or ignored what is clearly the central theme of His preaching? The poor, the hungry, the stranger, the sick are all vehicles to experience Jesus. When did I see Jesus hungry, in prison, sick or as a stranger? Apparently Jesus is not too concerned with the worthiness of the hungry ones, the sick ones or the strangers. It is not about them being deserving of my help; really it is not even about them but about my capacity and my ability to follow Jesus’ command to love. It is on that, and that alone that I am judged. Did I love? To ignore the needs of the sick is to miss an opportunity to love. To fail to welcome the stranger with open arms is a missed opportunity to love and to love the One.</p>

    <p>As a Christian, from a “Christian nation”, how can I be so blind to the Gospel I heard today? I rationalize,</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p><i>Maybe it isn’t THOSE sick ones or THOSE strangers I am to love. Maybe I am not supposed to love THOSE, the ones who don’t act like me, look like me, speak like me; those who aren’t “nice” like me? They haven’t deserved my love or apparently God’s. Of all my “brothers” they are surely “the least”. </i></p>

    </blockquote>
    <p>But that isn’t Jesus’ command. It is “Love one another” and especially, “Love your enemies.” “Ed, you MUST love!” Who of us is deserving of love – each other’s or God’s? Who of us was not at one time “the stranger,” as we were reminded recently?</p>

    <p>So I begin again today to love “the other”. It is in loving “the other” that I experience “the One”.</p>
