        <strong>Background: Relationship With St. Henry District High School</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        When Ed was the principal at Immaculate Heart of Mary School (IHM) in Burlington, KY - the district feeder high school was St. Henry District High School (SHDHS).Many of the 8<sup>th</sup> grade graduates from IHM moved on to SHDHS. Ed knew many of the students since his first year in 2000-2001 and the school families were supportive at IHM and continued at SHDHS.

        But it was in 2007, when Ed was contacted by Mikey and Michael Best that the relationship with the high school grew.Michael and his mom went to Kenya with a travel group and contacted Ed on their return. Michael was a student at SHDHS and he shared his experiences in Kenya with his school. He also shared his desire to continue work in Kenya through a relationship with the Ed Colina Foundation. Ed and Michael spoke to school assemblies and Ed shared his work with all religion classes, telling students of the work that they had been begun on behalf of SHDHS. Due to a number of supportive St. Henry HS staff, students participated in out-of-uniform days, Lenten collections, jewelry sales and contributions for malaria nets. The school began its specific work of constructing classrooms in Kenya.Specifically, the Foundation was working in a small Masai community near the town of Bisil. Over the years, SHDHS took responsibility for the construction of three preschool classrooms, provided desks, gutters and water tanks, uniforms, food and malaria nets. The classrooms are simple structures of iron-sheets and cement floors.

        In June of 2011, on behalf of SHDHS, four students and former students traveled to Kenya and painted classrooms, planted trees and held a soccer "clinic" with the young students. They purchased cows and goats for sustainability and brought soccer gear and soccer balls for the school.The classroom construction continued until the final class was built in 2012. The students from Grade 3 will "graduate" in November of 2013.There is a logical break at this grade level and the students, once too young to walk to the closest school, can now make the long journey and will begin 4th grade at another location. Therefore we will celebrate our first graduating class. The ceremony will be complete with caps and gowns, speeches from local leaders and a luncheon feast. The community will provide two goats for slaughter and the Foundation will purchase the rest of the food.

    But St. Henry District High School has not finished their support of the Foundation. In October 2013 the school presented the Foundation with yet another check for $2010. This donation will be used for the students at Bisil (St. Henry) School, providing rice, beans and water for their daily feeding program. The school donated shirts from their Spirit Shop and from the Drama Department. These will be distributed at the "graduation". Two of the school's cows, donated by SHDHS, were recently sold for over $1000 and the profits will continue to help the school and its sustainability projects.
