        Nyumbani Children’s Home is a refuge for HIV/AIDS-affected children.

        <p>


            provides life-saving care and a loving home to more than 120 HIV-positive children in Kenya. Ages newborn to 23, the children live at Nyumbani Children’s Home until they are healthy and self-reliant.
        </p>
        <p>
            The only one of its kind when it was in 1992, Nyumbani Children’s Home offers life-changing comprehensive medical, nutritional, dental, life-skills, psychological, academic and spiritual care.
        </p>
        <h3>
        First they must heal
    </h3> Children and babies often arrive in desperate malnourished condition, many abandoned by their families because of the stigma of HIV/AIDS. They come to us from as close as Nairobi to as far as Mombasa and represent every ethnicity in Kenya. Children are referred to Nyumbani by hospitals and our own community outreach program,
        <p>
            The most severely malnourished are brought to the Nyumbani Respite Center, where they are brought back to health and returned to their families, who first are trained in the children’s unique nutritional needs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most Nyumbani Children’s Home residents are on first- and second-line HIV/AIDS antiretroviral drugs (ARVs). Unfortunately, however, the number of children who are resistant to first and second-line ARVs and need third-line drugs is growing.
        </p>
        <h3>
        A holistic view of every child
    </h3>
        <p>
            But it’s not just about the children’s health.
            <br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            Nyumbani Children’s Home takes a whole-child approach to care and rehabilitation. We go beyond simply providing a bed for a child.
        </p>
        <p>

            In each of the cottages is a surrogate family, with 14 children and a house parent, usually a grandparent. Inter-generational companionship, a quality education, and post-graduation career counseling help ensure successful reintegration into their own families, tribal communities, or independent living.
        </p>
        <p>
            A particularly caring and competent >staff act as positive role models to help raise confident, happy children within native cultural traditions.
        </p>
        <h3>
        A bright future
    </h3>
        <p>
            Though death still threatens, today most Nyumbani children are living to adulthood with the promise of many productive years ahead. Availability of better ARV medicine and innovative treatment mean our children can expect a bright future.
        </p>
        <p>
            And that is the heart of what we do.
